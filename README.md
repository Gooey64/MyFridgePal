Presented at JumboHack 2025 under the <SUSTAINABILITY> track.

MyFridgePal is a super fun website that you can use to keep track of the items
in your fridge, freezer, or pantry! Log in and enter your food items to your 
fridge. Then you can view your items from anywhere using the website.

REFLECTION:

<What motivated your team to choose this project?>

Our passion for refrigerators.

<Potential future work/improvements?>

- Adding fridges + food items to database.

- MyFridgePal will be migrating to a mobile app format soon!

<What is a challenge you encountered while making this?>

We really didn't have a lot of experience with making a website that used a 
database, so we encountered a lot of connectivity issues.

<What is a fun or interesting experience you had with another hacker?>

Hanging out in JCC was sooooo fun!
